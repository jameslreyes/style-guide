2- Angles & Shots

→Shot Types

Extreme Long Shot: This shot is taken from a great distance, with the subject often hardly visible. The main purpose is to highlight the subject's surroundings, providing a sense of scale and geographical location.

Long Shot (also known as Wide Shot): This shot shows the entire subject along with its environment. For a person, a long shot would typically include the full body, providing context and a sense of scale.

Medium Shot: This shot typically frames the subject from the waist up or chest up. It's often used in dialogue scenes in movies to show a subject along with some context of their surroundings.

Closeup Shot: The subject takes up the full frame in this shot, usually focusing on the face for a person. This shot type emphasizes details and expressions, intensifying the emotions portrayed by the subject.

Extreme Closeup Shot: This shot typically features a part of a person or an object, such as a person's eye or a detail on an item. It brings attention to a specific feature or detail, emphasizing its significance.

Full Shot: This shot typically frames the subject fully from head to toe, capturing the entire body within the scene. It's often used to showcase the character's physicality or actions within the environment.

Two-Shot: A shot that includes two subjects, often used in conversation scenes. This shot helps establish the relationship between the characters and can show their reactions to each other.

Over-the-Shoulder Shot: This shot is taken from the perspective of a person standing behind a subject, with the person in the foreground's shoulder and back of the head included in the shot. It's often used in dialogue scenes to create a sense of depth and connection between the characters.

Point of View Shot: This shot is taken from the perspective of a subject, showing what the subject would see. It helps the audience identify with the character's perspective and experience the scene from the character's viewpoint.

Establishing Shot: This shot is typically an extreme long shot at the beginning of a scene, indicating where, and sometimes when, the remainder of the scene takes place. It sets the context for the audience by showing the setting and characters.

Master Shot: A master shot includes all the key figures in a scene and all the action happening in it. It's often the first shot of a scene, used to provide the viewer with the layout and dynamics of the scene's environment.

Low Angle Shot: This shot looks at the subject from below, making it appear larger, more dominant or powerful.

High Angle Shot: This shot looks at the subject from above, making it appear smaller or less significant.

Eye Level Shot: A neutral camera angle that is approximately at the subject's eye level, creating a natural perspective.

Dutch Angle Shot: A camera angle in which the camera is intentionally tilted to one side, creating a sense of disorientation or unease.

Overhead Shot: A camera angle that looks directly down on the subject from above, providing a unique perspective and context.

Bird's Eye View Shot: A higher vantage point than an overhead shot, as if the viewer were looking down from the sky or a very high altitude. It provides a wider perspective and can capture an entire scene or landscape, offering a sense of scale and context.

Drone Shot: An aerial camera angle using a drone that often provides higher perspectives than traditional bird's-eye views and overhead views.

Worm's-eye view: A camera angle that looks up at the subject from ground level, creating a dramatic and unusual perspective often used to make the subject appear formidable or threatening.

Ground-level view: In a ground-level view, the camera is placed at ground level. This can make for dramatic shots where the background rises up from the horizon line.

Side View: In this view, the camera is positioned to the side of the subject, showing the subject from one side.

Off-Center View: The subject is positioned away from the center of the frame to create visual interest or to reveal another element in the scene.

Rule of Thirds Shot: In this composition technique, the frame is divided into nine equal parts and the subject is positioned along one or more of the grid lines to create a balanced and interesting composition.

Candid Shot: A shot taken without the subject's knowledge or consent, often resulting in a more natural, relaxed look than posed shots.

Silhouette Shot: The subject is backlit and the camera is exposed for the background, making the subject appear as a dark silhouette against a brighter background.

Shot from Behind: This shot is taken from the back of the subject, capturing the subject's perspective of the environment ahead or focusing on the actions the subject is doing with their back turned. It's often used for dramatic or mysterious effects.

Underwater Shot: This type of shot captures images or scenes beneath the surface of water bodies like oceans, seas, lakes, or pools. It's often used to provide unique perspectives, reveal hidden underwater ecosystems, or to simply create visually stunning sequences that can't be replicated on land.

4- Filmmakers

If you are looking to add some style and atmosphere to your images, you can add a filmmaker's name to your prompt. 

If you start with a simple prompt like this one : 

"A woman in front of her house in a scene from a movie", you will get very varied and random results, without much artistic consistency. 

On the other hand, if you want to add, for example, the name of Peter Jackson to the same prompt: 

"A woman in front of her house in a scene from a movie directed by Peter Jackson", 

the results will be completely different and your images will be tinged with the style of this filmmaker, through more coarse elements such as the scenery, the architecture, the clothes worn or sometimes more subtle ones such as the camera shots, the lighting, the colors and the general atmosphere. 

You can be even more precise and add the title of one of the director's movies. In this example it could be "The Lord of the Rings". 

I did some tests and I noticed that adding the name of the movie alone seems to give less refined results than adding the name of the director alone, which seems to give something more coherent and harmonious. 

I invite you to test this and share your results to see if you notice the same or something different.

Finally, and this is even more subtle, but it seems that adding both the name of the director and the name of one of his movies in the same prompt adds a little more to the results. 

You can take it a step further by adding the genre of the movie (for example Science Fiction), the date the movie was released and even the camera and lens used for a particular scene you want to reproduce.

That said, adding a filmmaker's name to your prompt won't magically transform your images into an amazing scene but it will definitely add a special touch to them and it's really fun to try.

5- Photographers

If you're looking to add a unique touch to your photographs and give them a specific style and atmosphere, try adding a photographer's name to your prompt.

Since photographers have direct and immediate control over the visual elements of a photo, such as lighting, composition, and color grading, and their work is often immediately recognizable by these elements in a single image, adding their name in a prompt will often have a significant effect on the images generated by Midjourney.

Let’s talk about a little experiment I made.

First, I generated a series of 4 images with a simple prompt:

"A woman sitting on a park bench". The images generated were completely random, with no artistic direction.

Using the seed of the first generation of images, I used the same prompt and added the name of a famous photographer:

Annie Leibovitz

"A woman sitting on a park bench in the style of Annie Leibovitz".

While I have a basic understanding of photography, I'm far from an expert. So, I asked ChatGPT to describe to me what a photo of a woman sitting on a park bench taken by Annie Leibovitz might look like. 

Here are some elements of the answer:

→The lighting would likely be dramatic, with strong contrasts between light and shadow.

→The woman may be wearing a stylish and unique outfit, possibly a tailored coat or trench coat.

→Her expression would likely be contemplative or reflective, with a hint of vulnerability.

→The woman may appear to be middle-aged or older.

→The colors in the image may be desaturated, with a focus on earth tones.

→The background would be carefully selected and may feature natural elements, such as trees or foliage.

→Overall, the image would exude a sense of depth, emotion, and artistry, characteristic of Annie Leibovitz's style.

Almost all of those elements were present in the photography, at diverse levels!

I invite you to try it yourself.

You can also use some of ChatGPT's descriptions and integrate them into your prompts.

Since Annie Leibovitz is especially recognized for her magnificent portraits, adding here name in a prompt to generate a portrait should have a more significant impact on the result. To test it, I started again from a simple prompt:

"A portrait photography of a woman".

From this prompt, I got similar random results, without any artistic vision. By adding "in the style of Annie Leibovitz", the generated images were automatically imbued with her style. You could almost swear that she took the picture herself! 

Well, I'm exaggerating a bit but the result was surprising and even more consistent with her style because it was a portrait.

You can be even more precise by adding to your prompt the name of a camera, lens, and details about settings similar to those that Annie Leibovitz would have used for a portrait.

If you're not a photography expert, you can ask ChatGPT for more details on this. That is something I do all the time and it helps a lot!

I did a similar experiment withEdward Weston, a photographer among others recognized for his magnificent photos of mushrooms.

Prompts 1: "A photograph of a mushroom"

Prompts 2: "A photograph of a mushroom in the style of Edward Weston"

Prompts 3: "A photograph of a mushroom in the style of Edward Weston taken in 1931"

In the third prompt, I added the date the picture was taken. This is a very effective little trick to get an image even more tinged with the photographer's style.

Here is a short description of Weston's photo (Toadstool, 1931) as given by chat-GPT: "The image is characterized by its strong contrast between the dark background and the lighter tones of the toadstool, which makes the mushroom stand out and draws the viewer's attention. The lighting and tonal range in the photograph emphasize the texture and form of the toadstool, giving it an almost sculptural quality"

Try it yourself, the results are very consistent with this description! It is really surprising!

The result of these two experiments really amazed me! In the future, I will use the names of famous photographers more often in my prompts to get special artistic touches.

However, adding a photographer's name to a prompt is not the only guarantee of a magnificent result (several other aspects need to be considered such as how to structure your prompt, the words used, camera angles, etc.) but it is clear that it has a significant positive influence on the images generated with Midjourney.

I think it's a great way to learn more about photography and to experiment with new ideas and styles.

I've made a list of some of the greatest photographers of all time so you can have something you can refer to quickly. Obviously, this list is not complete, but it is a good starting point.

8- Cinematic Prompt Structure

Basic Prompt

A Cinematic scene, [SCENE/SUBJECT/ACTION] --ar 16:9 --v 5.1

Advanced Prompt

A Cinematic scene from [YEAR, MOVIE GENRE, MOVIE NAME] [SHOT TYPE] [SCENE/SUBJECT/ACTION] captured by [CINEMATIC CAMERA] film directed by [DIRECTOR] [EMOTION] [LIGHTING]

--ar 16:9 --style raw --v 5.1

The keyword, "Cinematic still or scene," is important as it prompts 'Mid journey', to interpret the image as a cinematic photo taken from an actual movie scene. If there's one key takeaway from this video for creating cinematic-looking images, it would be to use "Cinematic scene" as a keyword in your prompts without overcomplicating things.

After that, you need to describe the scene or subject for the creative direction you want to go.

The aspect ratio of 16:9 is excellent for achieving cinematic-looking images.

Of course you can enrich this prompt by adding more words like,

ultra realistic

film grain

cinematic color grading

detailed faces

dramatic lighting

These will help Mid journey to set the cinematic mood for your photos.

If you want an advance prompt for truly transformative cinematic design for your AI photos, you can use this:

In this prompt we are using a combination of shot types, camera names with cinematic features, filmmakers with unique art style, and we are setting the tone with genre, year, emotion and lighting. Together these will provide amazing value if you have something specific in mind.

I recommend using the 'style raw' parameter to fully leverage the visual style elements we incorporate in the prompt, especially if you mention a camera name or director's name with a unique style. This will exclude standard mid-journey style elements and make the algorithm truly focus on your style keywords.

9- Period Films and Year

Incorporating elements such as the Movie Year, genre, or movie name is optional, but when done correctly, they can definitely add tremendous value. The element of the movie year, for instance, can bring unique details from period films and art elements to your photos.

There are two things you can do:

First, You can visit a historical period with modern filmmaking production setup

I recommend this prompt for this job:

EXAMPLE PROMPT

A cinematic scene, detailed photograph from the fictional Oscar-winning historical drama 'The Last Empress'. The close up image captures the Empress in her royal attire, standing in the grand hall of her palace. The intricate details of her costume and the grandeur of the palace create a visually striking image that showcases the film's meticulous attention to historical accuracy and the stunning costume design that won it the Oscar. --ar 16:9 --v 5.1

I'd like to emphasize two critical aspects of this prompt. The usage of keywords such as "cinematic scene" and "fictional historical drama" is incredibly important. However, there's another element in the prompt that carries even more weight: costume design. The quality and historical accuracy of costumes can make or break historical period films. Therefore, I recommend using these keywords in your prompts: "intricate details of her costume" and "Oscar-winning costume design.”

10 - CREATE YOUR OWN CINEMATIC UNIVERSE

To achieve this start your prompt with this: A scene from (Your fictional movie year) (movie genre) film called (your fictional movie name)

11 - Film Genre List

Film Noir: Often features high-contrast lighting (chiaroscuro), low-key lighting, lots of shadows, and unique camera angles. The visual style helps to create an atmosphere of cynicism, moral ambiguity, and despair.

Horror: Generally features low-key lighting, high contrast, and often a darker color palette. Certain sub-genres within horror, like slasher films, might make use of stark, dramatic lighting and splashes of bright red for blood, while psychological horror might have a more muted, oppressive aesthetic.

Science Fiction: This genre varies widely, but often features futuristic or otherworldly sets, props, and special effects. The "cyberpunk" sub-genre is known for its distinctive neon lighting and grimy, high-tech environments.

Western: Typically features wide-open landscapes, warm color palettes, and natural light to emphasize the setting's harshness and grandeur.

Fantasy: Tends to use bright, saturated colors, and often features visually extravagant settings and costumes. High contrast and dramatic lighting are also common to emphasize magical or ethereal elements.

Romantic Comedy: Often uses high key lighting, which gives the film a bright, flat look. The color palette tends to be warm and inviting, creating a cheerful and romantic atmosphere.

Action: The visual style varies, but often includes high contrast lighting, fast-paced editing, and dynamic camera movements. Certain sub-genres, like superhero films, often have a glossy, high-tech aesthetic.

Musical: Usually features vibrant, saturated colors, dynamic choreography, and elaborate set pieces. Lighting is often dramatic and theatrical.

Period Drama: The visual style depends on the era being depicted, but typically features accurate costumes, props, and settings. The color palette, lighting, and cinematography often aim to evoke the mood and atmosphere of the period.

Animation: A genre that can take on virtually any visual style, but certain types are distinctive. For example, classic Disney films are known for their hand-drawn, highly detailed style, while modern Pixar films are noted for their bright, colorful 3D animation.
